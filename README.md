# 📊 Medicare Spending Data Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes Medicare hospital data across the United States to explore the relationship between healthcare costs and hospital quality. It combines two datasets—one containing general hospital information and another with cost metrics—to create an interactive Tableau dashboard for visual exploration.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, joining, preprocessing, and exploration  
- **Tableau** – Dashboard design and interactive visualization

## 📂 Data Sources
- **Hospital General Information Dataset**: Includes hospital names, locations, and quality ratings.
- https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u
- **Medicare Spending per Beneficiary Dataset**: Contains average cost data per beneficiary, standardized by state.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Integration (SQL)**
   - Fixed ZIP code formatting by preserving leading zeroes (e.g., “07102”) to ensure proper geographic mapping and accurate joins with location-based datasets.
   - Joined datasets on hospital identifiers

2. **Data Aggregation**
   - Calculated average cost per state
   - Computed average hospital ratings per state
   - Merged and summarized the results

3. **Visualization (Tableau)**
   - Created interactive U.S. maps for average costs and ratings
   - Built bar charts for top/bottom 5 states by cost and rating
   - Included scatterplot to visualize cost vs. quality correlation

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- **State-level maps** of average Medicare costs and hospital ratings
- **Top 5 / Bottom 5** bar charts for both cost and quality
- **Correlation scatterplot** between spending and hospital quality
