# Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary
This project analyzes Medicare hospital data across the United States to explore the relationship between healthcare costs and hospital quality. It combines two datasets—one containing general hospital information and another with cost metrics—to create an interactive Tableau dashboard for visual exploration.
(The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure compares a hospital’s Medicare Part A and B costs for care 3 days before, during, and 30 days after an inpatient stay to the national median. It shows if spending is higher, lower, or average.)
